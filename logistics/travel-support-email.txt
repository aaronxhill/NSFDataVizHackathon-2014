Dear <Participant>,

Thanks for your interest and ability to attend the upcoming workshop.
We have noted that you have requested travel support for the meeting.
Here are our current requirements for travel support:

1. Right now we will provide $285/night for 2 nights hotel stay in NYC area
(we are looking to NSF to see if we can get a supplement to expand this, but
itâ€™s not here yet)
2. Right now we can cover up to $680 airfare to NYC for the meeting

Both reimbursements above will be reimbursements in which you submit
your airline receipts and hotel receipts to USC and we will reimburse
you. Please submit your reimbursement request to Daisy Tang <daisy.tang@usc.edu>
and copy nsfdatavis@gmail.com on the email with the subject line:
