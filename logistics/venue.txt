Some info from Katie: There will definitely be one big screen/projector
and we can provide a laptop w/MS Office & Internet access - as well
as plugins (mac/pc) for those that want to use their own laptops.
WiFi won't be an issue - and I'll check with our Systems Administrator
about setting up an internal network for participants.

TODO 
===

* Figure out about dinner on first night - how to cover?  
* Audio-visual support - confirm?
